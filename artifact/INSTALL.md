# Installation Instructions

To set up the artifact, you need to set up Docker on a Linux host machine.
Since Docker needs to run in privileged mode to use Docker-in-Docker, you need full root access to the machine when running the images.

For installation instructions and examples running the experiments in Docker, please consult the [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) readme file.
