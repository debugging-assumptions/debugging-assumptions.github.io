# Requirements

Running the experiments and generating the results requires Docker running on a Linux machine with at least 16GB of RAM, a working internet connection and about 200GB of disk space available in the Docker build directory (default: `/var/lib/docker`).
To read instructions on how to build the Dockerfile and run the experiments, please consult the [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) document.

To view the results provided as tables, you need to install Microsoft Excel or a compatible spreadsheet viewer.
It is also possible to import the xlsx files into Google Sheets and view them inside a browser.
